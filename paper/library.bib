abstract = {Soft sensor technology is an important means to estimate important process variables in real-time. Modeling for soft sensor system is the core of this technology. Most nonlinear dynamic modeling methods integrate the processes of building the dynamic and static relationships between secondary and primary variables, which limits the estimation accuracy for primary variables. To avoid the problem, a kind of soft sensor model consisting of a dynamic model in cascade with a static one is proposed. The model identification and update online are conducted in substep way. In order to improve the model update efficiency, two improved Gauss–Newton recursive algorithms, which avoid nonsingular covariance matrix, are proposed for time-invariant and time-variant soft sensor systems. The uniform convergence for dynamic model parameter and the existence of estimation deviations for static model parameters are proved for time-invariant soft sensor system. The parameters of time-variant soft sensor system would be boundedly convergent. Case study confirms that, on the basis of the proposed model and recursive algorithms, the dynamic and static characteristics of soft sensor system can be described efficiently, and the primary variables are ensured to be estimated accurately.},

abstract = {This contribution proposes a new active learning strategy for smart soft sensor development. The main objective of the smart soft sensor is to opportunely collect labeled data samples in such a way as to minimize the error of the regression process while minimizing the number of labeled samples used, and thus to reduce the costs related to labeling training samples. Instead of randomly labeling data samples, the smart soft sensor only labels those data samples which can provide the most significant information for construction of the soft sensor. In this paper, without loss of generality, the smart soft sensor is built based on the widely used principal component regression model. For performance evaluation, an industrial case study is provided. Compared to the random sample labeling strategy, both accuracy and stability have been improved by the active learning strategy based smart soft sensor.},

abstract = {Originated from challenging industrial applications, this paper addresses a soft sensor development problem for linear systems with two types of measurements. One is fast, regular and delay-free measurements. The other is infrequent, irregular measurements with time-varying delays. The approach to be taken is based on the Kalman filter and data fusion technique, avoiding running the full augmented state Kalman filter, and leading to a considerably lower implementation cost. Although it is suboptimal, the loss in performance is minor compared to the optimal filter. Two simulation examples demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. An industrial soft sensor application example is also used to demonstrate its practicality.},

abstract = {Data-driven soft sensors have been widely used in both academic research and industrial applications for predicting hard-to-measure variables or replacing physical sensors to reduce cost. It has been shown that the performance of these data-driven soft sensors could be greatly improved by selecting only the vital variables that strongly affect the primary variables, rather than using all the available process variables. In this work, a comprehensive evaluation of different variable selection methods for PLS-based soft sensor development is presented, and a new metric is proposed to assess the performance of different variable selection methods. The following seven variable selection methods are compared: stepwise regression (SR), partial least squares with regression coefficients (PLS-BETA), PLS with variable importance in projection (PLS-VIP), uninformative variable elimination with PLS (UVE-PLS), genetic algorithm with PLS (GA-PLS), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling with PLS (CARS-PLS). Their strengths and limitations for soft sensor development are demonstrated by a simulated case study and an industrial case study.},

@article{Shang2015,
abstract = {Without an inclusion of process dynamics, traditional data-driven soft sensors are termed as static because only single snapshots of process samples are used. It leads to a series of limitations, such as sensitivity to temporal noises and inaccurate description in process dynamics. To this end, static models have been extended to dynamic versions thereof like dynamic partial least squares (DPLS) with lagged inputs for the sake of process dynamics. The dimension of soft sensor models' inputs, however, could be considerably larger than static ones, which leads to the over-fitting problem. In this paper, we introduce the concept of temporal smoothness as a novel approach to DPLS-based dynamic soft sensor modeling. The starting point is to not only include historical process data but also impose smoothness regularization on proximal dynamic parameters. The smoothness regularization assumes that historical inputs have smoothly varying impacts on the latent variables as a valid prior knowledge, which is in consensus with the physical truth of industrial processes. Therefore abrupt changes in model dynamics are desirably penalized and the DPLS-based soft sensors enjoy better generalizations and interpretations. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the advantages of temporal smoothness. A simulated Tennessee Eastman process study and a real quality prediction task in a crude distillation unit process are provided to show the feasibility as well as effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {Traditional data-based soft sensors are constructed with equal numbers of input and output data samples, meanwhile, these collected process data are assumed to be clean enough and no outliers are mixed. However, such assumptions are too strict in practice. On one hand, those easily collected input variables are sometimes corrupted with outliers. On the other hand, output variables, which also called quality variables, are usually difficult to obtain. These two problems make traditional soft sensors cumbersome. To deal with both issues, in this paper, the Student's t distributions are used during mixture probabilistic principal component regression modeling to tolerate outliers with regulated heavy tails. Furthermore, a semi-supervised mechanism is incorporated into traditional probabilistic regression so as to deal with the unbalanced modeling issue. For simulation, two case studies are provided to demonstrate robustness and reliability of the new method.},

abstract = {Iron ore sintering is the second-most energy-consuming process in steelmaking. The main source of energy for it is the combustion of carbon. In order to reduce energy consumptions and improve industrial competitiveness, it is important to improve carbon efficiency. Reliable online prediction of the carbon efficiency would be extremely beneficial for making timely adjustments to the process to improve it. In this study, the comprehensive carbon ratio (CCR) was taken to be a measure of the carbon efficiency; and a soft sensing system was built to make an online estimation of the CCR. First, the sintering process was analyzed, and the key characteristics of the process parameters were extracted. Then, the configuration of the soft sensing system was devised based on the characteristics of the process. The system consists of three parts: an image selection, an image segmentation, and a hybrid just-in-time learning soft sensor (HJITL-SS). First, an image selection method was devised to automatically select the key frames (KFs) from the video taken at the discharge end of the sintering machine. Then, a genetic-algorithm-based fuzzy c-means clustering method was devised to extract feature parameters from the KFs. Finally, an HJITL-SS, which consists of online and offline submodels, was devised to estimate the CCR using the extracted feature parameters as inputs. Actual run data were used to verify the validity of our system. Accuracy, overfitness, and error distribution of the HJITL-SS, offline, and JITL-based soft sensing methods were compared, which show the validity of the HJITL-SS. The actual run results also show the validity of the soft sensing system with 97{\%} of the actual runs are in an acceptable range.},

abstract = {This paper presents an integral technique for designing an inferential quality control applicable to multivariate processes. The technique includes a self-validating soft-sensor and a multivariate quality control index that depends on the specifications. Based on a partial least squares (PLS) decomposition of the online process measurements, a fault detection and diagnosis technique is used to develop an improved self-validation strategy that is able to confirm, correct or reject the soft-sensor predictions. Model extrapolations, disturbances or sensor faults are first detected through a combined statistic (that considers the calibration region); then, a diagnosis is made by combining statistics pattern recognition, contribution analysis, and disturbance isolation based on historical fault patterns. An off-spec alarm is produced when the proposed index detects that an operating point lies outside the integral design space driven by the specifications. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated by means of two numerical examples. First, a synthetic example is used to interpret the fundamentals of the method. Then, the technique is applied to the industrial Styrene-Butadiene rubber process, which is emulated through an available numerical simulator.},

@article{Liu2016,
abstract = {Soft sensors are used to predict response variables, as these variables are difficult to measure, the prediction models use data of predictors that are relatively easier to obtain. Arranging time-lagged data of predictors and applying the partial least squares (PLS) method to the dataset is a popular approach for extracting the correlation between data of the responses and predictors of the process dynamic. Because irrelevant inputs deteriorate the prediction performance of the soft sensor, the selection of variables in the PLS-based model is a critical step for developing a robust and accurate model. Furthermore, it is necessary to reselect the important predictors of a soft sensor when the operating mode is changed. However, a switch in the operating mode may not be measured, directly. In this study, two statistics are proposed to detect a change of operating mode to enable the reselection of the predictors of the soft sensor. This work involved the development of a soft sensor based on operating data from the industrial ethane removal (de-ethane) process. The changeover of crude oil types cannot be observed from the data of process variables; however, the correlation between input and output variables is significantly affected by the different types of crude oil. The result shows that the use of a soft sensor with online variable reselection is capable of maintaining the accuracy and robustness of the inferential model, effectively.},

                        3, was auto-controlled, and the reaction phase was performed by a sub-cycle operation consisting of a repeated short cycle of the anoxic-aerobic step. Using ORP and DO profiles, SBR status was divided into four categories of normal and abnormal cases; these were influent disturbance, aeration controller fault, instrument trouble and inadequate raw wastewater feeding. Through the DTW process, difference values (D) were determined and classified into seven cases. In spite of the misclassification of high loading rates, the ORP profile provided good diagnosis results. However, the DO profiles detected five misclassifications that indicated different statuses. After the DTW process, several statistical values, including maximum value, minimum value, average value, standard deviation value and three quartile values, were extracted and applied to establish the discriminant function. The discriminant analysis allows one to classify seven cases with a percentage of 100{\%} and 92.7{\%} for ORP and DO profiles, respectively. Consequently, the study showed that ORP profiles are more efficient than DO profiles as diagnosis parameters and DTW diagnosis algorithms and discriminants. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Shifted factor analysis (SFA) is designed to fit overall position shifts of sequential factors as well as the variation of factor weights. SFA is one kind of nonlinear generalization of linear factor models such as the two-mode principal component model and the three-mode Parafac model. Warped factor analysis (WFA), presented here, further generalizes SFA so that it fits factor variation due to not only the position shifts and the systematic weighting but also more flexible shape changes of sequential factors. A quasi alternating least squares (ALS) procedure is developed for WFA, using a simplified warping of segmented sequential factors. The most unique property of WFA is that it allows sequential factors to change shape distinctively, which is unlike what is implicitly assumed in mapping of data profiles, namely that sequential factors change shape together. Unlike the two-mode factor/component models, two-mode SFA was empirically shown to yield an essentially unique solution, using the additional sources of information provided by fitting systematic position shifts. Likewise, factors recovered by two-mode WFA are likely to be essentially unique due to the systematic shape variance fit by the model, provided that the data contain sufficient sources of shape variation.},

abstract = {Partial least squares regression has been an alternative to ordinary least squares for handling multicollinearity in several areas of scientific research since the 1960s. It has recently gained much attention in the analysis of high dimensional genomic data. We show that known asymptotic consistency of the partial least squares estimator for a univariate response does not hold with the very large p and small n paradigm. We derive a similar result for a multivariate response regression with partial least squares. We then propose a sparse partial least squares formulation which aims simultaneously to achieve good predictive performance and variable selection by producing sparse linear combinations of the original predictors. We provide an efficient implementation of sparse partial least squares regression and compare it with well-known variable selection and dimension reduction approaches via simulation experiments. We illustrate the practical utility of sparse partial least squares regression in a joint analysis of gene expression and genomewide binding data.},

The iPLS method is compared to full-spectrum partial least-squares and the variable selection methods principal variables (PV), for- ward stepwise selection (FSS), and recursively weighted regression (RWR). The methods are tested on a near-infrared (NIR) spectral data set recorded on 60 beer samples correlated to original extract concentration. The error of the full-spectrum correlation model be- tween NIR and original extract concentration was reduced by a factor of 4 with the use of iPLS (r 5 0.998, and root mean square error of prediction equal to 0.17{\%} plato), and the graphic output contributed to the interpretation of the chemical system under ob- servation. The other methods tested gave a comparable reduction in the prediction error but suffered from the interpretation advan- tage of the graphic interface. The intervals chosen by iPLS cover both the variables found by FSS and all possible combinations as well as the variables found by PV and RWR, and iPLS is still able to utilize the ® rst-order advantage.},

abstract = {Mutations in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae PIF1 gene, which encodes a 5'-to-3' DNA helicase, cause telomere lengthening and a large increase in the formation rate of new telomeres. Here, we show that Pif1p acts by inhibiting telomerase rather than telomere-telomere recombination, and this inhibition requires the helicase activity of Pif1p. Overexpression of enzymatically active Pif1p causes telomere shortening. Thus, Pif1p is a catalytic inhibitor of telomerase-mediated telomere lengthening. Because Pif1p is associated with telomeric DNA in vivo, its effects on telomeres are likely direct. Pif1p-like helicases are found in diverse organisms, including humans. We propose that Pif1p-mediated inhibition of telomerase promotes genetic stability by suppressing telomerase-mediated healing of double-strand breaks.},

abstract = {Fault detection plays an important role in power system to monitor and control which guarantees stable supply of electrical energy to consumers. In case of multiple faults or incorrect operation of protective devices, fault diagnosis requires judgement of complex conditions at various levels. A combined framework for achieving fault detection, classification, and location simultaneously has been proposed. The proposed framework is formed by a variety of analysis techniques, including state-space model, optimization technique, and analytical approach. To deal with the problem of an extremely large data set with different fault situations, state-space model have been proposed. A carefully selected signal is monitored in time or frequency domain in order to track deviations from its expected value. In this work stability study has been carried out by mathematical model of the system and its performance has been analysised in fault-free condition and faulty condition. In this paper, a novel framework that is able to rapidly detect and locate a fault in power system is presented. Using these techniques, the task of fault detection, classification, and locaiton are accomplished.},

abstract = {Abstract Neural network analyses based on the self-organizing map (SOM) and the growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) are used to examine patterns of the sea surface temperature (SST) variability on the West Florida Shelf from time series of daily SST maps from 1998 to 2002. Four characteristic SST patterns are extracted in the first-layer GHSOM array: winter and summer season patterns, and two transitional patterns. Three of them are further expanded in the second layer, yielding more detailed structures in these seasons. The winter pattern is one of low SST, with isotherms aligned approximately along isobaths. The summer pattern is one of high SST distributed in a horizontally uniform manner. The spring transition includes a midshelf cold tongue. Similar analyses performed on SST anomaly data provide further details of these seasonally varying patterns. It is demonstrated that the GHSOM analysis is more effective in extracting the inherent SST patterns than the widely used EOF method. The underlying patterns in a dataset can be visualized in the SOM array in the same form as the original data, while they can only be expressed in anomaly form in the EOF analysis. Some important features, such as asymmetric SST anomaly patterns of winter/summer and cold/warm tongues, can be revealed by the SOM array but cannot be identified in the lowest mode EOF patterns. Also, unlike the EOF or SOM techniques, the hierarchical structure in the input data can be extracted by the GHSOM analysis.},

abstract = {Process monitoring and fault diagnosis are crucial for efficient and optimal operation of a chemical plant. This paper proposes a reconstruction-based fault identification approach using a combined index for multidimensional fault reconstruction and identification. Fault detection is conducted using a new index that combines the squared prediction error (SPE) and T-2. Necessary and sufficient conditions for fault detectability are derived. The combined index is used to reconstruct the fault along a given fault direction. Faults are identified by assuming that each fault in a candidate fault set is the true fault and comparing the reconstructed indices with the control limits. Fault reconstructability and identifiability on the basis of the combined index are discussed. A new method to extract fault directions from historical fault data is proposed. The dimension of the fault is determined on the basis of the fault detection indices after fault reconstruction. Several simulation examples and one practical case are presented. The method proposed here is compared with two existing methods in the literature for the identification single-sensor and multiple-sensor faults. We analyze the reasons that the other two methods lead to erroneous identification results. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a rapid thermal annealing process for fault diagnosis. Fault subspaces of several typical process faults are extracted from the data and then used to identify new faults.},

abstract = {It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantiza- tion noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quantization schemes for 26 quanta, b = 1,2,...,7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

abstract = {Three allelic nuclear mutants affected in the recombination of mtDNA have been characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and assigned to the PIF locus. In the mutants, the general recombination measured by the recombination frequency between linked or unlinked alleles is normal. However, the pif mutations prevent the integration into the rho+ genome of the markers (oli1, oli2, diu1, ery, oxi1, oxi2) of those rho- genomes that have tandemly arrayed repeat units. Therefore, these rho- genomes characterize a PIF-dependent recombination system. The pif mutations have also revealed the existence of a PIF-independent recombination system used by those rho- genomes that have an inverted organization of their repeat units. The markers of such palindromic rho- genomes exhibit high integration frequency into the rho+ genome even in the presence of the pif mutation. In addition, the pif mutations greatly increase suppressiveness in crosses between pif rho+ strains and PIF-dependent as well as PIF-independent rho- clones. We conclude that the recombination between rho+ and rho- genomes involves at least two distinct systems that depend on the organization of the rho- genome.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview and analysis of statistical process monitoring methods for fault detection, identification and reconstruction. Several fault detection indices in the literature are analyzed and unified. Fault reconstruction for both sensor and process faults is presented which extends the traditional missing value replacement method. Fault diagnosis methods that have appeared recently are reviewed. The reconstruction based approach and contribution based approach are analyzed and compared with simulation and industrial examples. The complementary nature of the reconstruction and contirbution based approaches is highlighted. An industrial example of polyster film process monitoring is given to demonstrate the power of the contribution and reconstruction-based approaches in a hierarchical monitoring framework. Finally we demonstrate that the reconstruction-based framework provides a conveinient way for fault analysis, including fault detectability, reconsturctability and identifiability conditions, resolving many theoretical issues in process monitoring. Additional topics are summarized at the end of the paper for future investigation.},

In this paper an algorithm is presented for updating partial least squares (PLS) regression models with new calibration objects. The new data are included in the model by recursive updating of the loading vectors. This is done by representing old data by modifications of their loading matrices, while new data are represented by their x and y vectors. The algorithm keeps the sizes of the matrices that go into the PLS algorithm constant, instead of using ever growing X and Y matrices. The algorithm will be of use in any situation where new data are to be included in the calibration model after the initial calibration. Simulations have been run where the recursive algorithm is compared with traditional PLS.},

abstract = {We review the method of Parallel Factor Analysis, which simultaneously fits multiple two-way arrays or ‘slices’ of a three-way array in terms of a common set of factors with differing relative weights in each ‘slice’. Mathematically, it is a straightforward generalization of the bilinear model of factor (or component) analysis (xij = $\Sigma$Rr = 1airbjr) to a trilinear model (xijk = $\Sigma$Rr = 1airbjrckr). Despite this simplicity, it has an important property not possessed by the two-way model: if the latent factors show adequately distinct patterns of three-way variation, the model is fully identified; the orientation of factors is uniquely determined by minimizing residual error, eliminating the need for a separate ‘rotation’ phase of analysis. The model can be used several ways. It can be directly fit to a three-way array of observations with (possibly incomplete) factorial structure, or it can be indirectly fit to the original observations by fitting a set of covariance matrices computed from the observations, with each matrix corresponding to a two-way subset of the data. Even more generally, one can simultaneously analyze covariance matrices computed from different samples, perhaps corresponding to different treatment groups, different kinds of cases, data from different studies, etc. To demonstrate the method we analyze data from an experiment on right vs. left cerebral hemispheric control of the hands during various tasks. The factors found appear to correspond to the causal influences manipulated in the experiment, revealing their patterns of influence in all three ways of the data. Several generalizations of the parallel factor analysis model are currently under development, including ones that combine parallel factors with Tucker-like factor ‘interactions’. Of key importance is the need to increase the method's robustness against nonstationary factor structures and qualitative (nonproportional) factor change.},

Efficient algorithms are proposed to fit our SPCA models for both regular multivariate data and gene expression arrays. We also give a new formula to compute the total variance of modified principal components. As illustrations, SPCA is applied to real and simulated data with encouraging results. Key},

abstract = {Clenbuterol has been extracted by mixed solid-phase extraction from two biological matrices (bovine hair and urine) and detected by GC/MS (selected ion monitoring (SIM) and full-SCAN modes). The analytical signal has been modelled with univariate and three-way models, namely DTLD, PARAFAC, PARAFAC2, Tucker3 and trilinear PLS. Since clenbuterol is a banned substance a comparative study of the capability of detection (CC$\beta$, X0=0) has been performed as a function of the sample (hair, 74 $\mu$g kg-1 and urine, 0.36 $\mu$g l-1), the mode in which the signals are monitored (SCAN, 283 $\mu$g kg-1 and SIM, 74 $\mu$g kg-1) and the statistical model (univariate, 283 $\mu$g kg-1 and trilinear PLS, 20.91 $\mu$g kg -1). The capability of detection has been calculated as stated in ISO 11843 and Decision 2002/657/EC setting in all cases the probabilities of false positive and of false negative at 0.05. The identification of the mass spectra must be done to confirm the presence of clenbuterol and has been carried out through PARAFAC. The correlation coefficient between the spectra estimated by PARAFAC and the library spectra is 0.96 (hair, SCAN mode) and 1.00 (hair and urine, SIM mode). The Decision 2002/657/EC advocates the use of independent mass fragments to identify banned compounds. These recommendations together with the effect of the number of ions registered on the capability of detection have lead us to select five uncorrelated fragments (86, 243, 262, 264 and 277) from the data set of 210 ions by hierarchical clustering of variables. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To describe the dynamic processes properly, a dynamic PLS algorithm is proposed in this paper for dynamic process modeling, which captures the dynamic correlation between the measurement block and quality data block. For the purpose of process monitoring, a dynamic total PLS (T-PLS) model is presented to decompose the measurement block into four subspaces. The new model is the dynamic extension of the T-PLS model, which is efficient for detecting quality-related abnormal situation. Several examples are given to show the effectiveness of dynamic T-PLS models and the corresponding fault detection methods.},

abstract = { Daily wafer fabrication in semiconductor foundry depends on considerable metrology operations for tool-quality and process-quality assurance. The metrology operations required a lot of metrology tools, which increase FAB's investment. Also, these metrology operations will increase cycle time of wafer process. Metrology operations do not bring any value added to wafer but only quality assurance. This article provides a new method denoted virtual metrology (VM) to utilize sensor data collected from 300 mm FAB's tools to forecast quality data of wafers and tools. This proposed method designs key steps to establish a VM control model based on neural networks and to develop and deploy applications following SEMI EDA (equipment data acquisition) standards.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is highly susceptible to oxidative and chemically induced damage, and these insults lead to a number of diseases. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA helicase Pif1p is localized to the nucleus and mitochondria. We show that pif1 mutant cells are sensitive to ethidium bromide-induced damage and this mtDNA is prone to fragmentation. We also show that Pif1p associates with mtDNA. In pif1 mutant cells, mtDNA breaks at specific sites that exhibit Pif1-dependent recombination. We conclude that Pif1p participates in the protection from double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks or alternatively in the repair process of dsDNA breaks in mtDNA.},

The method preserves the shapes of peaks, merely altering their positions on the <i>x</i>-axis of the data set. The method involves coarse discrimination between baseline and peaks, generation of a sparse vector or a list representing peak maximum positions, and analysis of the vector or list for shift parameters using breadth first search or dynamic programming. The method can align peaks up to the spectral resolution of the acquiring instrument without restrictions on the number of peaks that are to be shifted. Furthermore, the speed and moderate number of meta-parameters of the algorithm make the method suitable for on-line implementation.

abstract = {Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a time-domain-based method and widely used in various similar recognition and data mining applications. This paper presents a phase-compensation-based DTW to process the motor current signals for detecting and quantifying various faults in a two-stage reciprocating compressor under different operating conditions. DTW is an effective method to align two signals for dissimilarity analysis. However, it has drawbacks such as singularities and high computational demands that limit its application in processing motor current signals for obtaining modulation characteristics accurately in diagnosing compressor faults. Therefore, a phase compensation approach is developed to reduce the singularity effect and a sliding window is designed to improve computing efficiency. Based on the proposed method, the motor current signals measured from the compressor induced with different common faults are analysed for fault diagnosis. Results show that residual signal analysis using the phase-compensation-based DTW allows the fault-related sideband features to be resolved more accurately for obtaining reliable fault detection and diagnosis. It provides an effective and easy approach to the analysis of motor current signals for better diagnosis in the time domain in comparison with conventional Fourier-transform-based methods.},

abstract = {The identification of disease-relevant genes represents a challenge in microarray-based disease diagnosis where the sample size is often limited. Among established methods, reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) methods have proven to be quite promising for variable selection. However, the design and application of an RJMCMC algorithm requires, for example, special criteria for prior distributions. Also, the simulation from joint posterior distributions of models is computationally extensive, and may even be mathematically intractable. These disadvantages may limit the applications of RJMCMC algorithms. Therefore, the development of algorithms that possess the advantages of RJMCMC methods and are also efficient and easy to follow for selecting disease-associated genes is required. Here we report a RJMCMC-like method, called random frog that possesses the advantages of RJMCMC methods and is much easier to implement. Using the colon and the estrogen gene expression datasets, we show that random frog is effective in identifying discriminating genes. The top 2 ranked genes for colon and estrogen are Z50753, U00968, and Y10871{\_}at, Z22536{\_}at, respectively.

abstract = {Fault detection has been recognized in the semiconductor industry as an effective component of advanced process control framework in increasing yield and product quality. Recently, conventional process monitoring-based principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to semiconductor manufacturing by quickly detecting when the process abnormalities have occurred. However, the unique characteristics of the semiconductor processes, nonlinearity in most batch processes, multimodal batch trajectories due to multiple operating conditions, significantly limit the applicability of PCA to the fault detection of semiconductor manufacturing. To explicitly address these unique issues in semiconductor processes, a principal components (PCs)-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) (named PCGMM) has been proposed in this paper. GMM is capable to handle complicated data with nonlinearity or multimodal features by a mixture of multiple Gaussian components, which is very suitable to describe observations from semiconductor processes. Furthermore, two quantification indexes (negative Log likelihood probability and Mahalanobis distance) are proposed for assessing process states, and a Bayesian inference-based calculation method is further used to provide the process failure probability. The validity and effectiveness of PCGMM-based fault detection model are illustrated through two simulation processes and a semiconductor manufacturing process. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model is superior to PCA-based monitoring models and can achieve accurate and early detection of various types of faults in complicated manufacturing processes.},

abstract = {The application of dynamic time warping(DTW) to the analysis and monitoring of batch process is presented. The dynamic-programming based technique has been used in the area of speech recognition for the recognition of isolated and connected words. DTW has the ability to synchronize two trajectories by appropriately translating, expanding, and contracting localized segments within both trajectories to achieve a minimum distance between the trajectories, due to the presence of batch-to-batch disturbances and the existence of physical constraints. To compare these batch histories and apply statistical analysis, one needs to reconcile the timing differences among these trajectories. This can be achieved using DTW with only a minimal amount of process knowledge. The combination of DTW and a monitoring method based on MPCA/MPLS is used for both offline and online implementation. Data from an industrial polymerization reactor are used to illustrate the implementation and the performance of this method.},

abstract = {In chemometrics the emphasis is on latent structure models. The latent structure is part of the data that the modelling task is based upon. This paper addresses some fundamental issues that arise when latent structures are used. The paper consists of three parts. The first part is concerned with defining the latent structure of a linear model. here the "atomic" parts of the algorithms that generate the latent structure for linear models are analyzed. It is shown how the PLS algorithm fits within this way of presenting the numerical procedures. The second part concerns graphical illustrations, which are useful when studying latent structures. It is shown how loading weight vectors are generated and how they can be intepreted in analyzing the latent structure. It is shown how the covariance can be used to get useful a priori information on the modelling task. Some simple methods are presented for deciding whether a single or multiple latent structures should be used. The last part is about choosing the variables that should be used in the analysis. The traditional procedure for selecting variables to include in the model are presented and the insufficiencies of such approaches are demonstrated. A case study to illustrate the use of CovProc methods is presented. The CovProc methods are discussed and some of their advantages are presented.},

The new method allow incorporation of a dEWMA control algorithm into the standard run-to-run controller design for semiconductor processes. The resulting structure of the PLS model can extract the strongest relationship between the input and output variables. It is particularly useful for inherent noise supression. In addition, the resulting non-square MIMO control system can be decomposed into a multiloop control system by employing pre-compensators and post-compensators of the PLS model, which is constructed from the input and output loading matrices. SUbsequently the conventional dEWMA controller can be separately and directly applied to each SISO control loop.

The decomposition of a multi-way array is developed as the product of a score vector and a loading array, where the score vectors have the same properties as those of ordinary two-way PCA and PLS. In image analysis, the array would instead be decomposed as the product of a loading vector and an image score matrix. The resulting methods are equivalent to the method of unfolding a multi-way array to a two-way matrix followed by ordinary PCA or PLS analysis. This automatically proves the eigenvector and least squares properties of the multi-way PCA and PLS methods. The methodology is presented; the algorithms are outlined and illustrated with a small chemical example.},

Operating personnel typically use only a few variables to monitor the plant's performance. However, multivariate statistical methods such as PLS (Partial Least Squares or Projection to Latent Structures) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) are capable of compressing the information down into low dimensional spaces which retain most of the information. Using this method of statistical data compression a multivariate monitoring procedure analogous to the univariate Shewart Chart has been developed to efficiently monitor the performance of large processes, and to rapidly detect and identify important process changes. This procedure is demonstrated using simulations of two processes, a fluidized bed reactor and an extractive distillation column.},

abstract = {The derivation of statistical properties of Partial Least Squares regression can be a challenging task. The reason is that the construction of latent components from the predictor variables also depends on the response variable. While this typically leads to good performance and intepretable models in practice, it makes the statistical analysis more involved. In this work, we study the instrinsic complexity of Partial Least Squares Regression. Our contribution is an unbiased estimate of its DOF. It is defined as the trace of the first derivative of the fitted values, as seen as a function of the response. We establish two equivalent representations that rely on the close connection of Partial Least Squares to matrix decompositions and Krylov subspace techniques. We show taht the Degrees of Freedom depend on the collinearity of the predictor variables: The lower the collinearity is, the higher the degrees of freedom are. In particular, they are typically higher than the naive approach that defines the DOF as the number of components. Further, we illusttrate how our DOF estimate can be used for the comparison of different regression methods. In the experimental section, we show that our degree of freedom estimate in combination with information criteria is useful for model selection.},

@article{Chiang2003,
abstract = {To implement on-line process monitoring techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares (PLS), it is necessary to extract data associated with the normal operating conditions from the plant historical database for calibrating the models. One way to do this is to use robust outlier detection algorithms such as resampling by half-means (RHM), smallest half volume (SHV), or ellipsoidal multivariate trimming (MVT) in the off-line model building phase. While RHM and SHV are conceptually clear and statistically sound, the computational requirements are heavy. Closest distance to center (CDC) is proposed in this paper as an alternative for outlier detection. The use of Mahalanobis distance in the initial step of MVT for detecting outliers is known to be ineffective. To improve MVT, CDC is incorporated with MVT. The performance was evaluated relative to the goal of finding the best half of a data set. Data sets were derived from the Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) simulator. Comparable results were obtained for RHM, SHV, and CDC. Better performance was obtained when CDC is incorporated with MVT, compared to using CDC and MVT alone. All robust outlier detection algorithms outperformed the standard PCA algorithm. The effect of auto scaling, robust scaling and a new scaling approach called modified scaling were investigated. With the presence of multiple outliers, auto scaling was found to degrade the performance of all the robust techniques. Reasonable results were obtained with the use of robust scaling and modified scaling. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There are two competing costs that occur in offline semiconductor processing metrology. One is the cost of operating the metrology tool, the other is the loss in terms of processing cost and yield due to the time lapse between the occurence and the correction of a process fault. Virtual metrology (VM) is an alternative scheme which takes data produced by the processing tool in real time (e.g. plasma etching data during isolation trench formation) and predicts an outcome of the wafer (e.g. critical dimension of the trench) utilizing an empirical model. Although VM prediction quality is not as good as that of conventional metrology, it produces an immediate, low cost prediction for each wafer going through a process. In real life, we envision that practical metrology schemes will involve a synergistic blend of VM and actual metrology, the latter being used for the needed periodic recalibration of the VM empirical model. In this work, we formulate the costs associated with Type I and Type II errors that result from a blended metrology scheme and propose a general framework that can be used to quickly lead to the opitmal design of such schemes given the characteristics of the process in question. We also explore the effects of a faulty process (by means of means shift) on the cost analysis.},

The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

abstract = {Correlation optimized warping (COW) based on the total ion current (TIC) is a widely used time alignment algorithm (COW-TIC). This approach works successfully on chromatograms containing few compounds and having a well-defined TIC. In this paper, we have combined COW with a component detection algorithm (CODA) to align LC-MS chromatograms containing thousands of biological compounds with overlapping chromatographic peaks, a situation where COW-TIC often fails. CODA is a variable selection procedure that selects mass chromatograms with low noise and low background (so-called "high-quality" mass chromatograms). High-quality mass chromatograms selected in each COW segment ensure that the same compounds (based on their mass and their retention time) are used in the two-dimensional benefit function of COW to obtain correct and optimal alignments (COW-CODA). The performance of the COW-CODA algorithm was evaluated on three types of complex data sets obtained from the LC-MS analysis of samples commonly used for biomarker discovery and compared to COW-TIC using a new global comparison method based on overlapping peak area: trypsin-digested serum obtained from cervical cancer patients, trypsin-digested serum from a single patient that was treated with varying preanalytical parameters (factorial design study), and urine from pregnant and nonpregnant women. While COW-CODA did result in minor misalignments in rare cases, it was clearly superior to the COW-TIC algorithm, especially when applied to highly variable chromatograms (factorial design, urine). The presented algorithm thus enables automatic time alignment and accurate peak matching of multiple LC-MS data sets obtained from complex body fluids that are often used for biomarker discovery.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present some useful methods for introductory analysis of variables and subsets in relation to PLS regression. We present here methods that are efficient in finding the appropriate variables or subset to use in the PLS regression. The general conclusion is that variable selection is important for successful analysis of chemometric data. An important aspect of the result presented is that lack of variable selection can spoil the PLS regression, and that cross-validation measures using a test set can show larger variation. When we use different subsets of X, than obtained by different methods. We also present an approach to orthogonal scatter correction. The procedures and comparisons are applied to industrial data.},

abstract = {Batch process monitoring methods, such as multiway PCA and multiblock multiway PLS, make use of process variable time profiles to normalize and define most likelihood trajectories for statistical process control. Nevertheless, a continuous process analytics counterpart has not been developed, nor addressed in the literature. This paper presents a novel methodology that defines "state variables" to determine the multiple operating points around which a continuous process operates. In this manner, the operating region is divided into multiple regions (states) and shifts in operating conditions are captured by such state variables. Transition trajectories between states are calculated to determine the most likely path from one state to another. This methodology is referred as multistate analytics and can be implemented in the context of empirical monitoring methods, named multistate PLS and multistate PCA. A case study using data from carbon dioxide removal process shows that multistate analytics is beneficial for statistical monitoring of continuous processes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel data projection method, local and global principal component analysis (LGPCA) is proposed for process monitoring. LGPCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique through preserving both of local and global information in the observation data. Beside preservation of the global variance information of Euclidean space that principal component analysis (PCA) does, LGPCA is characterized by capturing a good linear embedding that preserves local structure to find meaningful low-dimensional information hidden in the high-dimensional process data. LGPCA-based T 
                        2 (D) and squared prediction error (Q) statistic control charts are developed for on-line process monitoring. The validity and effectiveness of LGPCA-based monitoring method are illustrated through simulation processes and Tennessee Eastman process (TEP). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures meaningful information hidden in the observations and shows superior process monitoring performance compared to those regular monitoring methods. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Li2009,
abstract = {By employing the simple but effective principle 'survival of the fittest' on which Darwin's Evolution Theory is based, a novel strategy for selecting an optimal combination of key wavelengths of multi-component spectral data, named competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), is developed. Key wavelengths are defined as the wavelengths with large absolute coefficients in a multivariate linear regression model, such as partial least squares (PLS). In the present work, the absolute values of regression coefficients of PLS model are used as an index for evaluating the importance of each wavelength. Then, based on the importance level of each wavelength, CARS sequentially selects N subsets of wavelengths from N Monte Carlo (MC) sampling runs in an iterative and competitive manner. In each sampling run, a fixed ratio (e.g. 80{\%}) of samples is first randomly selected to establish a calibration model. Next, based on the regression coefficients, a two-step procedure including exponentially decreasing function (EDF) based enforced wavelength selection and adaptive reweighted sampling (ARS) based competitive wavelength selection is adopted to select the key wavelengths. Finally, cross validation (CV) is applied to choose the subset with the lowest root mean square error of CV (RMSECV). The performance of the proposed procedure is evaluated using one simulated dataset together with one near infrared dataset of two properties. The results reveal an outstanding characteristic of CARS that it can usually locate an optimal combination of some key wavelengths which are interpretable to the chemical property of interest. Additionally, our study shows that better prediction is obtained by CARS when compared to full spectrum PLS modeling, Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE) and moving window partial least squares regression (MWPLSR).},

abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) regression is a powerful and frequently applied technique in multivariate statistical process control when the process variables are highly correlated. Selection of the number of latent variables to build a representative model is an important issue. A metric frequently used by chemometricians for the determination of the number of latent variables is that of Wold's R criterion, whilst more recently a number of statisticians have advocated the use of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). In this paper, a comparison between Wold's R criterion and AIC for the selection of the number of latent variables to include in a PLS model that will form the basis of a multivariate statistical process control representation is undertaken based on a simulation study. It is shown that neither Wold's R criterion nor AIC exhibit satisfactory performance. This is in contrast to the adjusted Wold's R criteria which is shown to demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of the number of times the known true model is selected. Two industrial applications are then used to demonstrate the methodology. The first relates to the modelling of a product quality using data from an industrial fluidised bed reactor and the second focuses on an industrial NIR data set. The results are consistent with those of the simulation studies. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Batch process data can be arranged in a three-way matrix (batch × variable × time). This paper provides a critical discussion of various aspects of the treatment of these multiway data. First, several methods that have been proposed for decomposing three-way data matrices are discussed in the context of batch process data analysis and monitoring. These methods are multiway principal component analysis (MPCA)-also called Tucker1 - parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and Tucker3. Secondly, different ways of unfolding, mean centering and scaling the three-way matrix are compared and discussed with respect to their effects on the analysis of batch data. Finally, the role of the time variable in batch process data is considered and methods suggested to predict the per cent completion of batch runs with unequal duration are discussed.

abstract = {The objective of this work is the creation of preditive models that can forecast the electrical or physical parameters of wafers using data collected from the relevant processing tools. In this way, direct measurements from the wafer can be minimized or elminated altogether, hence the term "virtual" metrology. Challenges include the selection of the appropriate process step to monitor, the pre-treatment of the raw data, and the development of a Virtual Metrology Model (VMM) that can track a manufacturing process as it ages. A key step in any VM application is dimensionality reduction, i.e. ensuring that the proper subset of predictors is included in the model. In this paper, a software tool developed with MATLAB is demonstrated for interactive data prescreening and selection. This is combined with a variety of automated statistical techniques. These include step-wise regression and genetic selection in conjunction with linear modelling such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Squares (PLS). Modelling results based on industrial data sets are also used to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods.},

abstract = {Multivaraite statistical methods are used to analyze data from an industrial batch drying process. Theo bjective of the study was to uncover possible reasons for major problems occuring in the quality of the product produced in the process. Partial least-squares (PLS) methods were able to isolate which group of variables in the chemistry, in the timing of the various stages of the batch, and in the shape of the time-varying trajectories of the process variables were related to a poor-quality product. The industrial study illustrates the approach and the power of these multivariate methods for troubleshooting problems occuring in complex batch processes. Several new variations in the multivariate PLS methodology for the analysis of batch data are also implemented. In particular, an application u tilizing a novel approach to the time warping of the trajectories for batches, and the subsequent use of the time-warping information, is presented. The use of the time history of the PLS weights of the process variable trajectories to diagnose problems in the dynamic operation of the batches is also clearly illustrates, as is the use of good and bad batches.},

abstract = {A new and fast recursive, exponentially weighted PLS algorithm which provides greatly improved parameter estimates in most process situations is presented. The potential of this algorithm is illustrated with two process examples: (i) adaptive control of a two by two simulated multivariable continuous stirred tank reactor; and (ii) updating of a prediction model for an industrial flotation circuit. The performance of the recursive PLS algorithm is shown to be much better than that of the recursive least squares algorithm. The main advantage of the recursive PLS algorithm is that it does not suffer from the problems associated with correlated variables and short data windows. During adaptive control, it provided satisfactory control when the recursive least squares algorithm experienced difficulties (i.e., 'blew' up) due to the ill-conditioned covariance matrix, ((XX)-X-T)(t). For the industrial soft sensor application, the new algorithm provided much improved estimates of all ten response variables. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) is a well known dimension reduction method which has been recently adapted for high dimensional classification problems in genome biology. We develop sparse versions of the recently proposed two PLS-based classification methods using sparse partial least squares (SPLS). These sparse versions aim to achieve variable selection and dimension reduction simultaneously. We consider both binary and multicategory classification. We provide analytical and simulation-based insights about the variable selection properties of these approaches and benchmark them on well known publicly available datasets that involve tumor classification with high dimensional gene expression data. We show that incorporation of SPLS into a generalized linear model (GLM) framework provides higher sensitivity in variable selection for multicategory classification with unbalanced sample sizes between classes. As the sample size increases, the two-stage approach provides comparable sensitivity with better specificity in variable selection. In binary classification and multicategory classification with balanced sample sizes, the two-stage approach provides comparable variable selection and prediction accuracy as the GLM version and is computationally more efficient.},

@article{Schulz1994,
abstract = {A screen to detect yeast mutants that frequently lost expression of subtelomeric genes identified two mutations in PIF1, a gene known to encode a 5' to 3' DNA helicase. The loss of expression of subtelomeric genes in pif1 cells was due to deletion of the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes and the generation of new telomeres at proximal sites. In pif1 mutants, de novo telomere formation usually occurred at sites with very little homology to telomeric DNA. De novo telomere formation after HO-induced chromosome breakage also occurred at elevated frequencies in pif1 cells. Moreover, mutations in PIF1 caused all telomeres to lengthen. These results suggest that the PIF1 helicase is an inhibitor of both de novo telomere formation and telomere elongation.},

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

In this work, we propose a new formulation of PLS, such that after projecting out score vectors, the estimated coefficient matrix is obtained as the product of pseudo inverse of the predictor matrix and corresponding weighting matrices. The new formulation, which facilitates the calculation of Jacobian matrix and can be extended to multivariate PLS, is proved to be equivalent to the nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS). The prediction interval of the algorithm is developed based on the Jacobian of singular vectors. Industrial case studies demonstrate the utility of the algorithm for univariate PLS.},

abstract = {Since the introduction of covariance-based structural equation modelling by Joreskog in 1973. This technique has been received with considerable interest among empirical researchers. However, the predominance of LISREL, certainly the most well-known tool to perform this kind of analysis, has led to the fact that not all researchers are aware of alternative techniques for SEM, such as partial least squares (PLS) analysis. Therefore, the objective of this article is to provide an easily comprehensible introduction to this technique, which is particularly suited to situations in which constructs are measured by a very large number of indicators and where maximum likelihood covariance-based SEM tools reach their limit. Because this article is intended as a general introduction, it avoids mathematical details as far as possible and instead focuses on a presentation of PLS, which can be understood without an in-depth knowledge of SEM.},

@article{Dazard2012,
abstract = {The paper addresses a common problem in the analysis of high-dimensional high-throughput "omics" data, which is parameter estimation across multiple variables in a set of data where the number of variables is much larger than the sample size. Among the problems posed by this type of data are that variable-specific estimators of variances are not reliable and variable-wise tests statistics have low power, both due to a lack of degrees of freedom. In addition, it has been observed in this type of data that the variance increases as a function of the mean. We introduce a non-parametric adaptive regularization procedure that is innovative in that : (i) it employs a novel "similarity statistic"-based clustering technique to generate local-pooled or regularized shrinkage estimators of population parameters, (ii) the regularization is done jointly on population moments, benefiting from C. Stein's result on inadmissibility, which implies that usual sample variance estimator is improved by a shrinkage estimator using information contained in the sample mean. From these joint regularized shrinkage estimators, we derived regularized t-like statistics and show in simulation studies that they offer more statistical power in hypothesis testing than their standard sample counterparts, or regular common value-shrinkage estimators, or when the information contained in the sample mean is simply ignored. Finally, we show that these estimators feature interesting properties of variance stabilization and normalization that can be used for preprocessing high-dimensional multivariate data. The method is available as an R package, called 'MVR' ('Mean-Variance Regularization'), downloadable from the CRAN website.},

@article{Chen2004,
abstract = {Variable selection is often used to produce more robust and parsimonious regression models. But when they are applied directly to the raw near-infrared spectra, it is not easy to select appropriate variables because background and noise will often overshadow or overlap the absorption bands of analyte. In this work, a new hybrid algorithm based on the selection of the most informative variables in the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) domain is described. The strategy is a combination of CWT and a procedure of modified iterative predictor weighting-partial least square (mIPW-PLS). After elimination of the background and noise in NIR spectra by CWT, the mIPW-PLS approach is used to select the most informative CWT coefficients. With the selected CWT coefficients, a PLS model is built finally for prediction. It is indicated that the extraction of most important variables in the CWT domain can effectively avoid the interference of background and noise, and result in a high quality of regression model with a very small number of variables and fewer PLS components.},

Here a backward iterative step-by-step wrapper method is proposed using PLS. The root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) for an independent test set is used as selection criterion to quantify the gain obtained using the selected range of variables. The method has been applied to different data sets and the results obtained revealed that one can improve or at least keep constant the prediction performances of the PLS models compared to the full-spectrum models. Moreover with the advantage that the number of variables is reduced driving to an easier interpretation of the relationship between model and sample composition and/or properties. The aim is not to compare to other variable selection methods but to show that a simple one can improve or at least keep constant the prediction performances of the PLS models by using only a limited number of variables.},

To achieve this, artificial (noise) variables are added and a closed form of the PLS or PCR model is obtained for the data set containing the experimental and the artificial variables. The experimental variables that do not have more importance than the artificial variables, as judged from a criterion based on the b coefficients, are eliminated. The performance of the method is evaluated on simulated data. Practical aspects are discussed on experimentally obtained near-IR data sets. It is concluded that the elimination of uninformative variables can improve predictive ability.},

@article{Yu2008,
abstract = {For complex industrial process with multiple operating conditions, the traditional multivariate process monitoring techniques such as PCA and PLS are ill-suited because the fundamental assumption that the operating data follow a unimodal Gaussian distribution usually becomes invalid. In this article, a novel multimode process monitoring appraoch based on finite Gaussian mixture model and Bayesian inference strategy is proposed. First the process data are assumed to be from a number of different clusters, each of which corresponds to an operating mode and can be characterized by a Gaussian component. In the absense of a priori process knowledge, the Figueirdo-Jain algorithm is then adopted to automatically optimize the number of Gaussian components and estimate their statistical distribution parameters. With the obtained FGMM, a Bayesian inference strategy is further utilized to compute the posterior probabilities of each monitored sample belonging to the multiple components and derive an integrated global probablistic index for fault detection and multi-mode processes. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach are illustrated through three examples: 1. a simple multivariate linear system. 2. a simulated continuous stirred tank heater process, and 3. the Tenesse Eastman challenge problem. The comparison of monitoring results demonstrates that the proposed approach is superior to the conventioanl PCA method and can achieve accurate and early detection of various types of faults in multimode processes.},

@article{Sliskovic2011,
abstract = {There has been an increased use of soft-sensors in process industry in recent years. These soft-sensors are computer programs that are used as a relatively cheap alternative to hardware sensors. Since process variables, which are concerned with final product quality, cannot always be measured by hardware sensors, designing the appropriate soft-sensor can be an interesting solution. Additionally, a soft-sensor can be used as a backup sensor, when the hardware sensor is in fault or removed due to maintenance or replacement. Soft-sensor is based on the mathematical model of the process. Since industrial processes are generally quite complex, a theoretical modeling approach is often impractical, expensive or sometimes even impossible. Therefore, process model building is based on measured data. This approach significantly gets complicated if only plant data, taken from the process database, are available. In this paper the most popular methods for plant data-based modeling that appeared in the last two decades are summarized and briefly explained. Apart from giving a short survey of the most important papers, tips about choosing the appropriate methodology for process model building are also provided.},

abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

In this paper, we highlight a strategy that employs a new time shift alignment method derived from the well-known Rank Minimization method for aligning chromatographic peak shifts among samples and then uses trilinear decomposition methodology to interpret the overlapped chromatographic peaks in order to quantify analytes of interest. The performance of this novel strategy for chromatographic data analysis was evaluated using simulated chromatographic data as well as real chromatographic data. The results indicate that the new time shift alignment method can accurately correct time shifts in test samples even in the presence of unexpected interferences, and thus the low-rank trilinearity of the same analyte can be obtained, which will be helpful for trilinear decomposition to achieve the second-order advantage. Moreover, the results showed that this new alignment method is more automated in comparison with the Rank Minimization method and will be suitable for the alignment of the time shifts of analytes that are completely overlapped by coeluted interferences.},

abstract = {Fault diagnosis is important for ensuring chemical processes stability and safety. The strong nonlinearity and complexity of batch chemical processes make such diagnosis more difficult than that for continuous processes. In this paper, a new fault diagnosis methodology is proposed for batch chemical processes, based on an artificial immune system (AIS) and dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. The system generates diverse antibodies using known normal and fault samples and calculates the difference between the test data and the antibodies by the DTW algorithm. If the difference for an antibody is lower than a threshold, then test data are deemed to be of the same type of this antibody's fault. Its application to a simulated penicillin fermentation process demonstrates that the proposed AIS can meet the requirements for online dynamic fault diagnosis of batch processes and can diagnose new faults through self-learning. Compared with dynamic locus analysis and artificial neural networks, the proposed method has better capability in fault diagnosis of batch processes, especially when the number of historical fault samples is limited.},

Cluster analysis, primitive exploration with little or no prior knowledge, consists of research developed across a wide variety of communities. The diversity, on one hand, equips us with many tools. On the other hand, the profusion of options causes confusion. We survey clustering algorithms for data sets appearing in statistics, computer science, and machine learning, and illustrate their applications in some benchmark data sets, the traveling salesman problem, and bioinformatics, a new field attracting intensive efforts. Several tightly related topics, proximity measure, and cluster validation, are also discussed.},

abstract = {In order to increase the predictive ability of the PLS (Partial Least Squares) model, we have developed a new algorithm, by which uninformative samples which cannot contribute to the model very much are eliminated from a calibration data set. In the proposed algorithm, uninformative wavelength (or independent) variables are eliminated at the first stage by using the modified UVE (Uninformative Variable Elimination)-PLS method that we reported previously. Then, if the prediction error of the ith (1 < or =i< or = n) sample is larger than 3sigma, the corresponding sample is eliminated as uninformative, where n is the total number of calibration samples and sigma is the standard deviation calculated from the other n(-1) samples. Calculation of sigma by the leave-one-out manner enhances the ability to identify the uninformative samples. The final PLS model is constructed precisely because both uninformative wavelength variables and uninformative samples are eliminated. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the algorithm, we have applied it to two kinds of mid-infrared spectral data sets.},

In this article, we propose new identification methods, which use integrals of the relay response instead of the point data. The proposed methods guarantee better accuracy and advantages in obtaining the ultimate information of process as well as parametric models compared with previous approaches, because effects of the high order harmonic terms are supressed significantly using the integrals of the relay responses.},

The etching process is discussed in terms of three basic steps: absorption, product formation, and product desorption. Experiments performed in well-defined (nonplasma) environments are discussed with the goal of clarifying the relative importance of these three steps in the etching process. An attempt is made to relate the resulting concepts to several phenomena generally observed in plama situations (e.g. etching anisotropy, selective etching, the loading effect, and the role of additive gases). Moreover, the glow dischrage, in addition to generating active species which initiate the chemical reactions, also causes the etched surface to be subjected to energetic particle (ions, electrons) bombardment. The role of this radiation in the etching process is emphasized. Speculative comments relating to plasma etching parameters and apparatus are also given.},

Etch rates are determined using a choice of etch models while LPCVD uses a sticking coefficient model. A modified string algorithm which allows simultaneous etching and deposition is used to move the surface.

abstract = {For complex chemical processes with multiple operating conditions and inherent system uncertainty, conventional multivariate process monitoring techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) are ill-suited because they are unable to characterize shifting modes and process uncertainty. In this article, a novel hidden Markov model (HMM) based ICA approach is proposed for process monitoring and fault detection. First the hidden Markov model is built from measurement data to estimate dynamic mode sequence. Further the localized ICA models are developed to characterize various operating modes adaptively. HMM based state estimation is then used to classify the monitored samples into the corresponding modes, and the HMM based I2 and SPE statistics are established for fault detection. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach is demonstrated through the Tennessee Eastman Chemical process. The comparison of monitoring results shows that the proposed HMM-ICA approach is superior to the conventional ICA method and can achieve accurate detection of various types of process faults with minimized false alarms.},

Helicases that have significant sequence similarity define a subfamily. It remains unclear, however, how this sequence similarity relates to helicase function. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1p helicase is the prototype member of a helicase subfamily that is conserved from yeasts to humans. As the two Pif1p subfamily members studied to date affect the same DNA sequences, the amino acid similarity that defines this subfamily might reflect common substrates.},

abstract = {Wine age prediction based on its intrinsic characteristics can provide significant assistance to oenologists' quality evaluations, concerning wine ageing process control and wine quality assurance. Simpler, faster, cheaper and affordable analytical procedures would be greatly welcome to establish such a practice. In this study, we present a new and reliable strategy to predict wine age, in the long and short-term, centered on the use of wine UV-vis absorbance data, coupled with proper chemometric techniques. The strategy followed consists essentially in first pre-processing the UV-vis data, secondly to carry out variable selection over such pre-processed data sets, and finally to use the set of selected variables for developing a PLS model focused on wine age prediction. We tested different data pre-processing methodologies, namely first and second derivatives, multiplicative scatter correction, standard normal variate and orthogonal signal correction, as well as different variable selection approaches, specifically interval partial least squares, VIPS, genetic algorithms and the wavelet transformation combined with a genetic algorithm. In both case studies, regarding long and short-term ageing periods, we have found out that it is indeed possible to predict wine ages, in our case Madeira wine ages, with an accuracy of 1.4 years for longer ageing periods, and of 3 months for wines of an age comprised in the first two years of ageing. The genetic algorithm revealed to be very useful for proper wavelet coefficients selection, leading to the most parsimonious model among all those analyzed, which also presents the best predictive performance found.},

abstract = {The phenomena called cockle are small wrinkles on the paper surface that appear during paper production. This condition poses significant economic and operability problems in the production of magazine paper, as it deteriorates the printabilty of the paper. There are many and varied sources that can lead to cockle, and their detection is often very complicated. In this work a multivariate hierarchical approach is proposed to analyze the cause of cockle. The hierarchy has two levels, the first of which is a three-way decomposition and analysis of the data collected from sections of a paper machine. The second level is a two-way decomposition and analysis between the combined loadings from the three-way decomposition and the measured cockle data. The results show that this approach is capable of identifying the important process sections and process variables, in spite of the large dimensionality of the problem. Data analyzed from two real industrial paper machines, involving several grades of paper, are used to demonstrate the proposed hierarchical approach. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Design of experiments for parameter estimation in dynamic systems is receiving more attention from process sytem engineers. In this paper, a PCA based optimal criterion (P-optimal) for model based DOE is proposed that combines PCA with information matrix analysis. The P-optimal criterion is a general form that encompasses most widely used optimal design criteria such as D-,E-, and SV-optimal, and it can automatically choose the optimal objective funciton (criterion) to use for a specific differential and algebraic (DAE) system. Two engineering examples are used to validate the algorithms and assumptions. The advantages of P-optimal DOE include ease of reducing the scale of opitmization process by choosing parameter subsets to increase estimation accuracy of specific parameters and avoid an ill-conditioned information matrix.},

abstract = {Fault detection and isolation (FDI) are important steps in the monitoring and supervision of industrial processes. Biological wastewater treatment (WWT) plants are difficult to model, and hence to monitor, because of the complexity of the biological reactions and because plant influent and disturbances are highly variable and/or unmeasured. Multivariate statistical models have been developed for a wide variety of situations over the past few decades, proving successful in many applications. In this paper we develop a new monitoring algorithm based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA). It can be seen equivalently as making Multiscale PCA (MSPCA) adaptive, or as a multiscale decomposition of adaptive PCA. Adaptive Multiscale PCA (AdMSPCA) exploits the changing multivariate relationships between variables at different time-scales. Adaptation of scale PCA models over time permits them to follow the evolution of the process, inputs or disturbances. Performance of AdMSPCA and adaptive PCA on a real WWT data set compared and contrasted. The most significant difference observed was the ability of AdMSPCA to adapt to a much wider range of changes. This was mainly due to the flexibility afforded by allowing each scale model to adapt whenever it did not signal an abnormal event at that scale. Relative detection speeds were examined only summarily, but seemed to depend on the characteristics of the faults/disturbances. The results of the algorithms were similar for sudden changes, but AdMSPCA appeared more sensitive to slower changes.},

abstract = {A collection of methods will be presented, designed to reflect special purpose or features in data. Many chemometrics methods can be viewed as an application of special weighting shcemes of the type presented here. After a short review of the H-principle of mathemtcail modelling, it will be applied to develop different weighing schemes and some simple ways to judge the quality or significance of a weighing scheme. Weighing schemes for two-way data will be established. We shall show how a loading vector can be adapted to a given score vector in order to improve the possibilities of intepertation of the results. These result will be extended to multiway data. It will be shown how we can develop different weighing schemes for multiway data depending on the purpose of intepretability of the results. The importantce of these weighing schemes is due to the fact that they yield or emphasize the part of data that is "in focus" in relation to the task in question.},

@article{Jong1992,
abstract = {A novel algorithm for partial least squares (PLS) regression, SIMPLS, is proposed which calculates the PLS factors directly as linear combinations of the original variables. The PLS factors are determined such as to maximize a covariance criterion, while obeying certain orthogonality and normalization restrictions. This approach follows that of other traditional multivariate methods. The construction of deflated data matrices as in the nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)-PLS algorithm is avoided. For univariate y SIMPLS is equivalent to PLS1 and closely related to existing bidiagnolization algorithms. This follows from an analysis of PLS1 regression in terms of Krylov sequences. For multivariate Y there is a slight difference between the SIMPLS approach and NIPALS-PLS2. In practice, the SIMPLS algorithm appears to be fast and easy to intepret as it does not involve a breakdown of the datasets.},

abstract = {This paper provides a state of the art review of the methods and applications of data-driven fault detection and diagnosis that have been developed over the last two decades. The scope of the problem is described with reference to the scale and complexity of industrial process operation, where multi-level hierarchical optimization and control are necessary for efficient operation, but are also prone to hard-failure and soft operational faults that lead to economic losses. Commonly used multivariate statistical tools are introduced to characterize normal variations and detect abnormal changes. Further, diagnosis methods are surveyed and analyzed, with fault detectability and fault identifiability for rigorous analysis. Challenges, opportunities, and extensions are summarized with the intent to draw attention from the system and control community and the process control community.},
